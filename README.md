.src TLD
========
**.src**, a TLD for developers, by developers.

This is a reboot of the excellent [TLD.js](https://github.com/ozten/TLD.js) idea, which turned out not to be possible because of ICANN restrictions on 2-letter TLDs.

This is a work-in-progress project, and we aim for it to grow into the
piece of work that is to apply, pay for and manage a TLD. Everything
must have a beginning.

Principles
----------
.src is...

* Affordable
* Community-driven
* Garbage-free (vs. parked domains, spam, and other garbage; hopefully)

The goal is to have a functional domain for developers to use.

Request for comments
--------------------
Elaborating the policies, the application, the whole thing will be
crowdsourced. This is a big project and we need plenty of people to
pitch in!

We are going to use this repo as a folder for everything (documents) we
need. So we'll be drafting policies, applications, you name it.

We have issues to solve, questions to answer, plans to make, and stuff
to organize. Those are organized in [the issues section][2].

* Love marketing? We're going to [need some help with that][3].
* Have some opinion on the policies we should have? [Good][4].
* Speak legalese? We [need you here][5].
* Know how things should work on the technical side? [Show us][6]!
* Namespacing geek? Yup, [that's important][7].
* ICANN and governmenty insider? [Come here please][8]!
* Concerned about who will run this thing? [Pitch in][9]!

So volunteer, create an issue, make a pull request, discuss it! 

Let's get cracking!

Preliminary plan
----------------
* Define the project
* Raise awareness
* Raise money
* Create a managing entity
* Wait for the next round of gTLD applications
* Apply to ICANN
* Get accepted
* Manage the "thing"

Q&A
---
### Why not use `.io`?
* Registration isn't cheap (Â£60, $100)
* It is controlled by another entity and country
* It doesn't have the same interests as the developer community
* It doesn't have specific policies against parking/spam, etc.

### Who will run this?
For now, as the project is in its infancy, I,
[@joallard](//github.com/joallard), will see to its maintenance.

As it grows bigger, I expect a ~~comittee~~ ~~team~~ taskforce to steer
the project and eventually make it into a non-profit entity. The
specifics remain to be determined by... community consensus.

An early suggestion inherited from TLD.js would be getting under
Mozilla.org's non-profit umbrella, but the we can figure this out after
a successful application.

## Still-relevant text inherited from TLD.js
### Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the
web every day...  Shouldn't we have a TLD that JS hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... jquery.js to jquery,
node.js goes to the node project, etc.

Got a side project and need a *cheap*, **hawt name**? heavymetal.js or
whatever is yours.

Domain squatters will not be tolerated, to the best of the projects
ability to limit or ban this behavior...

### After Kickstarter 
Again, the governance committee would figure out how
to make care and feeding of TLD.js sustainable and low maintence. This
is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough
funds to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.js`` domains will be  as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a
way to reward everyone who helped us secure this TLD.
