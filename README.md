.src TLD
========
**src**, a TLD for developers, by developers.

This is a reboot of the excellent [TLD.js](https://github.com/ozten/TLD.js) idea, which turned out not to be possible because of ICANN restrictions on 2-letter TLDs.

This is a work-in-progress project, and we aim for it to grow into the
piece of work that is to apply, pay for and manage a TLD. Everything
must have a beginning.

Principles
----------
DotSRC is...

* Affordable
* Community-driven
* Garbage-free (vs. parked domains, spam, and other garbage; hopefully)

The goal is to have a functional domain for developers to use.

In the meantime
---------------
We have issues to solve, questions to answer, plans to make, and stuff
to organize. Let's get cracking!

Preliminary plan
----------------
* Define the project
* Raise awareness
* Raise money
* Create a managing entity
* Wait for the next round of gTLD applications
* Apply to ICANN
* Get accepted
* Manage the "thing"

### Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the
web every day...  Shouldn't we have a TLD that JS hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... jquery.js to jquery,
node.js goes to the node project, etc.

Got a side project and need a *cheap*, **hawt name**? heavymetal.js or
whatever is yours.

Domain squatters will not be tolerated, to the best of the projects
ability to limit or ban this behavior...

### After Kickstarter 
Again, the governance committee would figure out how
to make care and feeding of TLD.js sustainable and low maintence. This
is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough
funds to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.js`` domains will be  as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a
way to reward everyone who helped us secure this TLD.

### Who will run this?  
[I](http://github.com/ozten) and the signers
below, offer to volunteer our time to organize this applicaiton process.
If we get it, we'll create a governance committee to figure how to best
steward this beast.

An early suggestion would be getting under Mozilla.org's non-profit
umbrella, but the we can figure this out after a successful application.
